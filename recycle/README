This one is probably a bit niche but you never know...

My local council uses Recycle Bank to encourage residents to recycle.  Curb-side recycling is a bit half-baked though and users must log in to the website and hit a button each week (just like a trained monkey!) to tell Recycle Bank that they have recycled that week.  Folks forget, can't be bothered or just don't care.

Oh well!

Rather than log in each week and hit a button, I think I'd rather have the computer do it for me.  If you're like minded, grab the script and stick a line in your crontab:

  00 09 * * wed /path/to/script/recycle.sh your.email@address.com password >/tmp/recycle.log 2>&1

This runs at 0900 on Wednesday.  Change it as you see fit (everyday is fine; you might even get a few sneaky points this way!).

Output is from the curl commands, both a bit of JSON.  The second one should read:

  {"result":"success"}

If you have already recycled then it will return "error".  Anything else and it is probably broken :)  Nothing more, nothing less.

Free as in beer.

Update November, 2013:
This no longer works as 'Recycle Bank' has be rebranded 'Green Redeem' and I closed my account due to privacy issues.  Left for reference though; handy web scrape, cookie hacking, etc...
