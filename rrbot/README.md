# What is /u/rr-bot?

It's a bot that automatically replies to comments and posts asking 'What is the RR?', a frequently asked question on /r/bodyweightfitness. The RR is the [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine).

# Who created you?

/u/spaceyjase created me using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [PRAW](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/praw) library.

# Lemme see!

Oh you! My source might be [here](https://github.com/spaceyjase/scripts/tree/master/rrbot), but no peeking!
