This repository contains random scripts that I often cobble together to make the computer do the boring, repetitive tasks that it should do.

There's nothing really technical here; most scripts are a pragmatic way to solve a problem or just simply a learning exercise.  The Internet is an ideal place for this, making the repository an easy reference for later use.
