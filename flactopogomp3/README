Convert flac to a decent (ish) mp3 version for streaming on a pogoplug (because it doesn't do flac via the clients!).  Retains original tags from the flac version.  Creates the original path on the mounted file system.

Handy little script, doesn't necessarily have to be used in conjunction with a pogoplug ;)

Searches from the current directory so make sure the current working directory is somewhere sensible.
