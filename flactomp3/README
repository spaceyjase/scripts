Convert flac to a decent (ish) mp3 version.

Originally intended for streaming from a pogoplug because it didn't do flac via the clients but since modified to output to the path specified.  Retains original tags from the flac version.  Creates the original path on the mounted file system.

Searches from the current directory so make sure the current working directory is somewhere sensible.

TODO:
Sensible command line parsing.
