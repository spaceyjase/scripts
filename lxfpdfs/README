lxfpdfs

http://linuxformat.co.uk/

Subscribers to the excellent Linux Format (URL above) get to grab their latest and greatest in PDF format via the website.  Back issues are also available and, for those that don't subscribe then they can get older issues too.  Amaze.

However, this is just for subscribers ;)

The script expects a surname and subscriber number (as it cobbles together a cookie to feed the LXF website) and then iterates through available PDFs, checks to see if they exist locally and downloads them if not.  You get lovely feedback or tons of error messages if it goes horrible wrong.

The script expects to find a 'downloads' directory local to the script (it doesn't create one).

Combining PDFs:
Check your repo for 'pdftk'.  Install it and change the working directory to an issue's PDFs.  Run the following command:

    pdftk *.pdf cat output LXF147.pdf

The combined output is put into LXF147.pdf.  It isn't ordered but as each file contains an article, it can be read properly!

TODO:
* Create the downloads directory if it doesn't exist ;)
* Better error handling
* Allow non-subscribers to download available PDFs (those that are free to all)
* Should probably store something in ~/.lxfpdfs rather than check local files
  so the user can move them around, you know?

DONE:
* Script groups issue PDFs into directories based off the name, e.g. LXF146/*.pdf.  If you've used a previous version, run 'movepdfs.sh' from the download directory to move 'em all into the right location so the script doesn't break (mostly!).  The 'movepdfs.sh' script was a quick hack.

Free as in beer.
