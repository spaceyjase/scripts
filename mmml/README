OK, 'Make Main Menu Launcher' (mmml) creates a .desktop file in '~/.local/share/applications' based on the name given in the dialog.

Use:

python mmml.py (or ./mmml.py, after a 'chmod u+x' if you like).

Why?  Because xfce is rubbish with .desktop files where it count (the panel launcher is OK though, which this is modelled on).  Give me a shout if you know different!

Free as in beer.
