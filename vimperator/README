Vimperator is a fantastic add-on for Mozilla Firefox. It is also capable of additional features through the plugin system. I needed a command to quickly hit my iGoogle page so here's a plugin for it.

I may do more, who knows. vimperator kind of needs a ':google mail' or ':google docs' type plugin, you know? ;)
